        your conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation and
        goodwill. If we delete your account for the foregoing reasons, you may

      <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will
        Website Operator, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
        agents, suppliers or licensors be liable to any person for (a): any
        indirect, incidental, special, punitive, cover or consequential damages
        (including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, revenue,
        sales, goodwill, use of content, impact on business, business
        interruption, loss of anticipated savings, loss of business opportunity)
        however caused, under any theory of liability, including, without
        limitation, contract, tort, warranty, breach of statutory duty,
        negligence or otherwise, even if Website Operator has been advised as to
        the possibility of such damages or could have foreseen such damages. To
        the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the aggregate liability
        of Website Operator and its affiliates, officers, employees, agents,

        amount greater of one dollar or any amounts actually paid in cash by you
        to Website Operator for the prior one month period prior to the first
        event or occurrence giving rise to such liability. The limitations and

      </p>
      <h2>Severability</h2>
      <p>
        All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be exercised
        and shall be applicable and binding only to the extent that they do not
        violate any applicable laws and are intended to be limited to the extent
        necessary so that they will not render this Agreement illegal, invalid
        or unenforceable. If any provision or portion of any provision of this
        Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a
        court of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that
        the remaining provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their
        agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such
        remaining provisions or portions thereof shall remain in full force and
        effect.
